## Buildings

1. declare the spawn position (x,y) and size (x,y) of buildings in each room. They are declared in "createBuidlings()" (line 685 in gta.js)
- Set the ID of the building in "createBuildings()" as well
- If you spawn a building without position coordinates, you can set them in the css file using top:, left:. Set visual styles per building as well.
2. add case in "teleportToRoom()" (line 321 in gta.js)
3. add handling logic for collision with building in "checkCollision()" (line 402 in gta.js)

### Uses

The buildings are used as actual buildings shown in gameworld. But they can be used as objects as well. The teleport "doors", casino "game tables" and more are just buildings.
